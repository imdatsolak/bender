# Julia Resources

This directory contains all locations in Germany with their community (Gemeinde), County (Kreis), and State (Bundesland). Additionally, there is data about ZIP-Code, Area-Code, Car-Plate and the latitude and longitude of that location.

Some locations have "STATUS"-information. Normally, this is only if the location is a CITY.

The "locations.list.txt" is used for quick lookup, but it is not complete.

"locations.pickle" contains the real data. the '.json'-version is stored here just for your convenience (human-readable), but it is not used by Julia
